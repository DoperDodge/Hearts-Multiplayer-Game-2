  { title: 'THE PASS', icon: '🔄', content: 'Before each hand, you select 3 cards to pass to another player. The direction rotates: Left → Right → Across → No Pass. Choose wisely — get rid of dangerous cards like high Spades and Hearts!' },
  { title: 'PLAYING TRICKS', icon: '🃏', content: 'The player with the 2 of Clubs leads the first trick. You MUST follow suit if you can. If you can\'t, you may play any card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick. There is no trump suit.' },
  { title: 'BREAKING HEARTS', icon: '💔', content: 'Hearts cannot be led until they are "broken." Hearts break when someone discards a Heart (or Queen of Spades) because they can\'t follow suit. After that, Hearts can be led freely.' },
  { title: 'SCORING', icon: '📊', content: 'Each Heart = 1 point. Queen of Spades = 13 points. All other cards = 0 points. Total penalty per hand is always 26 points. Points are BAD — avoid them!' },
  { title: 'SHOOT THE MOON', icon: '🌙', content: 'If you capture ALL 13 Hearts AND the Queen of Spades in one hand, you "Shoot the Moon!" Instead of getting 26 points, every OTHER player gets 26 points and you get 0. A risky but powerful strategy!' },
  { title: 'STRATEGY TIPS', icon: '💡', content: 'Pass the Queen of Spades and high Spades early. Try to void a suit to create discard opportunities. Watch for players collecting all the Hearts — they might be shooting the moon! Keep low cards as safe leads.' },
